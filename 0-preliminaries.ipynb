    "Most datasets in NASA's archive are stored as NetCDF, HDF5, or TIFF formats. Occaisionally, NASA Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs) will host services such as [OpenDAP](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/collaborate/open-data-services-and-software/api/opendap) to provide server-side subsetting functionality, which becomes increasingly useful as the size and complexity of individual data files grows. These services allow users to circumvent downloading entire files, instead extracting a subregion or subset of observational variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative emerging access pattern is to use data formats that allow client-side subsetting instead of maintaining complicated server applications. [Cloud-Optimized Geotiff (COG)](https://www.cogeo.org) for example, is a format that uses internal tiling in order for client-side software libraries to retrieve only portions of a single file over a network connection. This notebook illustrates how this functionality"
